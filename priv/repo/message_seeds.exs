# Script for populating the database. You can run it as:
#
#     mix run priv/repo/message_seeds.exs
#
# Inside the script, you can read and write to any of your
# repositories directly:
#
#     Argus.Repo.insert!(%Argus.SomeSchema{})
#
# We recommend using the bang functions (`insert!`, `update!`
# and so on) as they will fail if something goes wrong.

# If you need to reset the database:

# mix ecto.drop
# mix ecto.create
# mix ecto.migrate
# MIX_ENV=test mix ecto.drop
# MIX_ENV=test mix ecto.create
# MIX_ENV=test mix ecto.migrate

# If you remake the database you need to comment out device supervisor in application.ex, otherwise seeds will crash
